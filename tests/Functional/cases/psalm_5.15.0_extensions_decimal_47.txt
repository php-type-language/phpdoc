 * String representation.
 *
 * This method is equivalent to a cast to string.

 * This method should not be used as a canonical representation of this
 * decimal, because values can be represented in more than one way. However,
 * this method does guarantee that a decimal instantiated by its output with
 * the same precision will be exactly equal to this decimal.
 *
 * @return string the value of this decimal represented exactly, in either
 *                fixed or scientific form, depending on the value.
