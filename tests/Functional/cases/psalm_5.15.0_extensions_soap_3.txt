/**
 * Calls a SOAP function
 * @link https://php.net/manual/en/soapclient.soapcall.php
 * @param string $function_name <p>
 * The name of the SOAP function to call.
 * </p>
 * @param array $arguments <p>
 * An array of the arguments to pass to the function. This can be either
 * an ordered or an associative array. Note that most SOAP servers require
 * parameter names to be provided, in which case this must be an
 * associative array.
 * </p>
 * @param array $options [optional] <p>
 * An associative array of options to pass to the client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The location option is the URL of the remote Web service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The uri option is the target namespace of the SOAP service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The soapaction option is the action to call.
 * </p>
 * @param mixed $input_headers [optional] <p>
 * An array of headers to be sent along with the SOAP request.
 * </p>
 * @param array $output_headers [optional] <p>
 * If supplied, this array will be filled with the headers from the SOAP response.
 * </p>
 * @return mixed SOAP functions may return one, or multiple values. If only one value is returned
 * by the SOAP function, the return value of __soapCall will be
 * a simple value (e.g. an integer, a string, etc). If multiple values are
 * returned, __soapCall will return
 * an associative array of named output parameters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * On error, if the SoapClient object was constructed with the exceptions
 * option set to <b>FALSE</b>, a SoapFault object will be returned.
