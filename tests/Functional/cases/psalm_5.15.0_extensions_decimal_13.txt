/**
 * Sum
 *
 * The precision of the result will be the max of all precisions that were
 * encountered during the calculation. The given precision should therefore
 * be considered the minimum precision of the result.
 *
 * This method is equivalent to adding each value individually.
 *
 * @param array|\Traversable $values
 * @param int                $precision Minimum precision of the sum.
 *
 * @return Decimal the sum of all given values.
 *
 * @throws \TypeError if an unsupported type is encountered.
 * @throws \ArithmeticError if addition is undefined, eg. INF + -INF
